## Clone Repository
Clone the repository from `GitHub` using `SSH` in the terminal. It is required to have `git` installed on your machine for the `git` command to work.

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:hackdanismo/microblog.git
```

## Development
When using the `MAMP Pro` server locally, the application will be available to view using the following URL and port: `https://microblog:8890/` - an `SSL certificate` has been setup locally.
